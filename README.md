# flutter_messages_clone

Cloning the Google Android Messages app. 

This one is a bit more structured than the other app. But could use some DRY Everywhere!! xD

Pull Requests are welcome!. 

Issues that im trying to Solve & Learn:
 - The list is rerendering every time I swipe a message. Which changes all the colors again. 
 - Get the Sound Notification picker working
 - The keyboard picker in the New Conversation is not changing the keyboard type. (Really dont know how to get it working)
 
Features Im Working on:
 - The conversation view. 
 - Typing messages. 
 
Things i would like in the future:
  - For the app to actually conect to the messages and contacts for a full working version.
